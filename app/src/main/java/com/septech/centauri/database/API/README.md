This directory will handle most of the API requests by implementing functions that handle the request all in a single call.


API Requests are categorized into four different requests:

GET - returns something to the client from the server
POST - sends something from the client to the server
PUT - updates something on the server from the client
DELETE - deletes something from the server

In this case, the "server" is the API, which can be thought of as a tunnel directly to the database. In essence, the server becomes the database.
